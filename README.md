# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines that leads to unexpected results. The bug involves an incorrect ordering of pipeline stages or a missing stage which results in an inaccurate aggregation of data.

## Bug Description

The provided aggregation pipeline intends to group documents by a specific field, count the occurrences of each group, sort the groups by count in descending order, and then limit the results to the top 10. However, due to an error in the pipeline's stages or their order, the output is incorrect.

## Bug Reproduction

1.  Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running.
2.  Create a collection and insert some sample documents.
3.  Run the provided aggregation pipeline in the `bug.js` file.
4.  Observe the incorrect results.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining each stage in the aggregation pipeline. This includes identifying the root cause of the incorrect aggregation, such as missing stages, incorrectly ordered stages, or logical errors within stages.

The corrected pipeline is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file.
